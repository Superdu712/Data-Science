### This assignment will provide some practice carrying out and interpreting PCA

### Part 1.  Iris Data

# a) [2 points] Using the Iris dataset from class, carry out PCA on the covariates 
# (these are Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width). Create a new R 
# object containing the output, and apply the summary command. Copy your commands 
# and results of the summary command below.

# b) [2 points] How do you interpret the contents of the summary command output?

# c) [2 points] What are the loadings and what are the scores? Output them below and
# provide an interpretation.

# d) [2 points] Plot the labeled iris data in the new basis, as discussed in lecture.

# e) [2 points] Create a scree plot as discussed in class. Is there a natural 
# break point? Where? How much dimensionality reduction do you recommend in this 
# dataset? Why did you expect this outcome?

### Part 2.  Wine Data

# Carry out parts a) through e) as above on the wines.txt dataset uploaded to moodle.
# In that dataset each row is a different wine, and each column is a different chemical
# measured in each wine.
